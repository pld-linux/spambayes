 Instructions:
 
 1.  Download the spambayes package.  I'll assume you've put it in
-    $HOME/src/spambayes.
+    /usr/lib/spambayes.
 
 2.  Create a new database:
 
-      $HOME/src/spambayes/hammiefilter.py -n
+      /usr/lib/spambayes/hammiefilter.py -n
 
 3.  (optional) Train it on your existing mail:
 
-      $HOME/src/spambayes/mboxtrain.py -d $HOME/.hammiedb -g $HOME/Mail/inbox -s $HOME/Mail/spam
+      /usr/lib/spambayes/mboxtrain.py -d $HOME/.hammiedb -g $HOME/Mail/inbox -s $HOME/Mail/spam
 
     You can add additional folder names if you like, using -g for "good"
     mail folders, and -s for "spam" folders.
